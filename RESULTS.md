### Patient (maker) execution

| Strategy | Filled | Expired | Pending | Fill rate | Spread saved per fill |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| maker_flat | 164 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 2.61¢ |
| maker_sports | 496 | 4 | 0 | 99% | 1.4¢ |

These post passively at the bid instead of crossing to the ask. Unfilled orders are counted — a strategy that only fills when it is about to be wrong (adverse selection) will show a high fill rate with poor results.

**Equity is the only honest headline** — realized P&L alone hides losses sitting in open positions. In this lab unrealized has been negative 97% of the time, so a realized-only view systematically overstates performance.

**Read 'minus best win' before believing any P&L** — a strategy whose profit disappears without its single luckiest trade hasn't proven anything yet.

### Active strategies
- **super** — the best empirical part of every earlier strategy: 30–70¢ only, never in-play, momentum or pregame-whale signal (veto on disagreement), no chasing, conviction-sized stakes ($100–250)
- **mid_momentum** — momentum restricted to 30–70¢ where payoffs are symmetric (frozen as v1, the control)
- **mm_sports** — mid_momentum, sports only (the one refinement walk-forward supports)
- **mm_tight** — mid_momentum, sports + 45–70¢ (walk-forward says the band cut is unjustified; running as the fitted arm)
- **mm_slow** — mid_momentum, only markets resolving in 2+ days
- **mm_strong** — mid_momentum, requires a ≥8¢ move instead of ≥5¢
- **mm_max** — all four refinements at once: sports, 45–70¢, 2+ days, ≥8¢
- **momentum** — buys whichever side moved ≥5¢ in 24h
- **fade_longshot** — sells the lottery tickets (buys the 90–98¢ side)
- **strong_dip** — buys a side knocked down ≥10¢ that is still the favourite
- **copy_top** — mirrors top-10 leaderboard wallets' pregame buys (in-play skipped)
- **copy_pro** — copy trading with all refinements: filtered wallets, 6h freshness, no chasing, conviction stakes
- **whale_fade** — bets against copy_top's picks (its control)
- **ai_judge** — bets when a local model (Ollama on the runner) disagrees with the market by >4¢ after costs; the AI's skill is judged like any other strategy
- **random_control** — coin flips, the baseline every strategy must beat

Retired (history kept, no new bets): longshot, mean_revert, late_favorite, favorite, copy_month — each empirically buried by its own ledger.
